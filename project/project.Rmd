# Introduction

**TLDR**: Pick (or create) a dataset and do something with it. That is your final project.

The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your 
own choosing or creation. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your 
own data using a survey, by conducting an experiment, or by scraping the web. 
You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other
courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate 
proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you 
like) and apply them to a dataset in a meaningful way.

# Data sources

In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is 
important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should 
be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be 
explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations and at least 
10 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). 
The datasetâ€™s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical 
variables, and continuous numerical variables.

All analyses must be done in RStudio. If you are using a dataset that comes in a 
format that we haven't encountered in class (for instance, a `.DAT` file), make 
sure that you are able to load it into RStudio as this can be tricky depending 
on the source. If you are having trouble, ask for help before it is too late.

**Reusing datasets from class:** Do not reuse datasets used in examples / homework 
in the class. However, you are welcome to *extend* datasets. For instance, if 
you were interested in a more detailed analysis of the Pokemon dataset, you are
welcome to use web scraping to add variables such as Pokemon type or evolution
status to the existing dataset.

# Project proposal

**Due Friday, April 3 at 11:59pm US Eastern Time on Gradescope.**

The proposal is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well as a 
data analysis plan and your dataset, and is comprised of sections 1 through 3
as detailed below. 

Your write up and all typesetting must be done using R Markdown. All team
members must contribute to the GitHub repository. Before you finalize your write 
up, make sure the printing of code chunks is turned off with the chunk option 
`echo = FALSE`. 

When applicable you should use the functions and packages introduced in the 
course. However, we realize not all datasets and research questions are 
identical. Thus, use tidyverse syntax when possible, but if you use a package 
that we have not discussed in the course, we will be more lenient regarding 
tidyverse syntax (that being said, no dollar signs!). Remember to use good 
coding style and best visualization practices as discussed by Eric Monson. 

**You must turn in your proposal as a .pdf to Gradescope in order to receive credit.**

### Section 1 - Introduction

The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data 
(where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the 
variables, etc.). This section should be no more than one page, excluding 
figures.

### Section 2 - Data analysis plan

The data analysis plan should include:

- The outcome (dependent, response, $Y$) and predictor (independent, 
explanatory, $\mathbf{X}$) variables you will use to answer your question.
- Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics 
and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more
about your data. (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)
- The statistical method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your 
question(s). (You can update these later as you work on your project.)
-  What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your 
hypothesized answer?

This section should be no more than two pages, excluding figures.

### Section 3 - Data

Place your data in the `data` folder in your team's repository, and then add the
dimensions of your dataset and a codebook to the `README` in this folder. 
Finally, print out the output of `glimpse` of your data frame.

Make sure you only print the `glimpse` output of your dataset.

# Main write-up

**Due Wednesday, April 29 at 2:00pm US Eastern Time on Gradescope.**

There is no page limit or requirement, but do be judicious in your write-up. 
The full write-up should build on your project proposal above. That is,
**you should build on the Markdown file from your project proposal** (the entire
write-up should be one document by the end of the course). 

When applicable you should use the functions and packages introduced in the 
course. However, we realize not all datasets and research questions are 
identical. Thus, use tidyverse syntax when possible, but if you use a package 
that we have not discussed in the course, we will be more lenient regarding 
tidyverse syntax (that being said, no dollar signs!). Remember to use good 
coding style and best visualization practices as discussed by Eric Monson. 

**You must turn in your write-up as a .pdf to Gradescope in order to receive credit.**

### Sections 1 through 3

"Finalize" sections 1 through 3 with final visualizations, etc. These will not
be re-graded, but subsequent sections will build on these so make sure they are
set. It could be that you do not need to change anything from your project
proposals -- this is ok too!

### Section 4 - Methods and Results

Use the remainder of your write up to showcase how you arrived at answers to 
your question using any techniques we have learned in this class (and some 
beyond, if you're feeling adventurous). The goal is not to do an exhaustive 
data analysis (i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have 
learned for every variable), but rather let me know that you are proficient at 
asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, 
that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting 
and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your 
research questions. Be sure to discuss any assumptions you are making and 
whether they are satisfied.

### Section 5 - Discussion

This section is a one to two page conclusion and discussion. This will require a 
summary of what you have learned about your research question along with 
statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. Also, critique your own 
methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining 
to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the 
statistical analysis should also be discussed here. A paragraph on what you 
would do differently if you were able to start over with the project or what you 
would do next if you were going to continue work on the project should also be 
included.

# Summary slides

**Due Wednesday, April 29 at 2:00pm US Eastern Time on Gradescope.**

In addition to the write-up, your team must also create three (3) presentation
slides that summarize and showcase your project (do not include a "title" slide;
all slides should have content). Introduce your research question and dataset,
showcase a visualization, and give us some conclusions. These slides should
serve as a brief visual accompaniment to your write-up and will be graded for 
content and quality. For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document
to be submitted to Gradescope.

**You must turn in your slides as a .pdf to Gradescope in order to receive credit.**

# Overall notes

The project is very open ended. For instance, in creating a compelling 
visualization(s) of your data in R, there is no limit on what tools or 
packages you may use. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A 
single high quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large 
number of poor quality visualizations.

Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is 
turned off with the option `echo = FALSE`. 

Finally, pay attention to details in your write-up and presentation. Neatness, 
coherency, and clarity will count.

# GitHub repository

**You must turn in relevant components to Gradescope in order to receive credit.**

In addition to your Gradescope submissions, we will be checking your GitHub 
repository. This repository should be contributed to equally by all team members
and should include

* RMarkdown file (formatted to clearly present all of your code and results)
that will output the proposal and write-up in one document
* Meaningful README file on the GitHub repository
* Dataset(s) (in csv or RData format, in a `/data` folder)
* Presentation (if using Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides, export to PDF and put 
in repo, in a `/presentation` folder)

Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make 
sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted.

# Tips

- You're working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will 
happen, issues will arise, and thatâ€™s fine! Commit and push often, and ask 
questions when stuck.

- Review the grading breakdown and ask questions if any of the expectations are 
unclear.

- Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and 
quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team 
members).

- *Code*: In your write up your code should be hidden (`echo = FALSE`) so that 
your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include 
all your code such that if I re-knit your Rmd file I should be able to obtain 
the results you presented. **Exception:** If you want to highlight something 
specific about a piece of code, you're welcome to show that portion. 

- *Teamwork*: You are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are 
expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group 
assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have 
sufficiently contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. 
While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it 
is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code 
and approaches in 
the assignment works.

# Grading

The grade breakdown is as follows:

**Team peer evaluation:** You will be asked to fill out a survey where you 
rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member. This survey may modify
the individual grade received by each group member. It is possible to have your 
grade fall from an "S" to "U" if your individual contribution is not significant 
throughout the project's duration.

Grading of the project will take into account the following:

- Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy 
of data to those questions?
- Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?
- Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, 
writing, and explanations?
- Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the 
limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into 
the planning and implementation of the project?

A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:

- *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical 
concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in 
the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.
- *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together 
an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates 
most results clearly to others.
- *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several 
areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication 
of results is sometimes unclear.
- *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding 
of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication 
of results is unclear.
- *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.

# Late work policy

**There is no late work accepted on this project.** Be sure to turn in your 
work early to avoid any technological mishaps.

With the outbreak of the global coronavirus pandemic, we understand that not
all students may be in the same timezone. With this understanding, however, 
we will be strict regarding late work with respect to the US Eastern Time Zone,
and **all components must be submitted to Gradescope by the deadline** in order
to receive credit.

**If you do not turn in your final project on time, you will not pass the course.**
